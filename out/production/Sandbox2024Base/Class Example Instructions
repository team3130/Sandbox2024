Class Instructions:

1) Create your own Class in src folder, not in the ExampleClasses Folder
    - name it anything you want, but all the code in the class with conform to this theme
    - don't just randomly choose something that doesn't make sense
    - E.g. if I make class "Monster", I could have
        - instance variables: int size, double weight, String species, boolean isDangerous, String name
        - constructor: Monster(name, species, size, weight)
        - methods: getSize(), getWeight(), isDangerous(), addWeight(),
        - objects: dracula, frankenstein, giorgia

2)  Create some instance variables
    - REQUIRED: ave at least 2 integers, 1 double, 1 String

3) Write a constructor
    - try to take in at least one variable

4) Write some methods
    - REQUIRED: 2 setters, 2 getters, 2 random print methods
    - think: what is the difference between returning a value and printing it? what about modifying a value?
    - think: when should a method return void?
    - think: when do I want my method to pass in a parameter?

5) psvm: create some objects off of this class, and mess around
    - REQUIRED: create 3 objects
    - test out your methods by calling them ff of these objects, print out values and see what happens
    - try: what happens if you call a modifying method and then after, try to out the variable it modified?
